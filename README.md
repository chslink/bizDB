# MemoryDB

MemoryDB is an in-memory database written in Go (Golang). It provides a simple and efficient way to store, retrieve, update, and delete data. The primary goal of MemoryDB is to be lightweight, fast, and easy to use for small-scale applications.

## Features

- **In-Memory Storage**: Data is stored entirely in memory, which makes read and write operations very fast.
- **ACID Transactions**: Supports ACID transactions to ensure data consistency.
- **Simple API**: Provides a straightforward API for common database operations like Get, Put, Delete, etc.
- **Concurrency Support**: Allows concurrent access to the database with proper synchronization mechanisms.

## Installation

To install MemoryDB, you need to have Go installed on your system. You can then download and install it using the following command:

```sh
go get github.com/chslink/bizdb
```

## Usage

Here is a basic example of how to use MemoryDB in a Go application:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/chslink/bizdb"
)

func main() {
	// Create a new MemoryDB instance
	db := bizdb.New()

	// Put some data into the database
	err := db.Put("user:1", []byte(`{"name": "Alice"}`))
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error putting data:", err)
		return
	}

	// Get data from the database
	data, err := db.Get("user:1")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error getting data:", err)
		return
	}
	fmt.Println("Data retrieved:", string(data))

	// Delete data from the database
	err = db.Delete("user:1")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error deleting data:", err)
		return
	}
	fmt.Println("Data deleted successfully")
}
```
